## Description

Budget buddy is a weekly budget tracking application. Budget buddy allows you to set a weekly budget. If you overspend, you are notified by the application. The application will also track your expenses by category to inform you on what you spend your money on. And how much you spent. Budget buddy also shows you a real time pie chart to make it easy to understand what is going on with your spending habits.
